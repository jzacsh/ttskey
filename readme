An effort to make TTS in Ubuntu, for highlighted text, much easier. This is
really just a wrapper around some disparate existing tools in GNU/Linux for a
particular use-case.

@TODO
- write a gnome(v2) applet (see applet/) to change `espeak` speed on the fly
  eg.: call bin/tts_{pause,resume} accordingly as events are emitted for
  integer changes by the user moving the slider, just like the volume applet in
  GNOME.
- write an install script to initalize bin/tts_xsel and bin/tts_pause to ALT+s
  and ALT+SHIFT+s, respectively (find documention for `gnome-keybinding-properties`).
